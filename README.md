# Third Semester

This project contains coursework and assignments from various subjects that I took during the third semester at university. The projects are written in C, MATLAB, and C++, focusing on algorithm development, data structures, and systems programming.

## Subjects and Descriptions

### Estrutura de Dados 1 (Data Structures 1)

In this course, we focused on the basics of algorithms and data structures using the C programming language. The assignments included implementing fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Key hard skills developed in this course include:

- **AVL Tree**: Implementation of balanced binary search trees to maintain efficient search times.
- **DLIST (Doubly Linked List)**: Implementation of doubly linked lists to allow bidirectional traversal and manipulation.

These tasks were designed to provide a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and efficient data manipulation.

### Fundamentos de Computação 3 (Computing Fundamentals 3)

This subject covered fundamental computing concepts using MATLAB, including algorithm development, linear programming, and matrix operations. The coursework involved writing MATLAB programs to implement linear programming solutions and perform operations on matrices. These assignments were designed to strengthen our problem-solving skills and understanding of core computing principles.

### Técnicas de Programação 2 (Programming Techniques 2)

This course was centered on advanced programming techniques in C++ using QT Creator. The assignments included creating more complex programs that incorporated Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as polymorphism, templates, single inheritance, and multiple inheritance. The focus was on developing robust and optimized code, with tasks that challenged our ability to write efficient and maintainable programs.

## Technologies Used

- **C**: Programming language for systems and application development.
- **MATLAB**: Numerical computing environment.
- **C++**: Programming language with a focus on OOP.
- **QT Creator**: Integrated development environment for C++ and QML.
- **Linux**: Operating system for running and testing programs.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xfelipealves/ThirdSemester.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ThirdSemester
    ```
3. Compile and run the C and C++ programs using a GCC compiler. This was tested on a Linux OS like Ubuntu.

Example for running a C program:
    ```bash
    gcc -o program_name program_name.c
    ./program_name
    ```

Example for running a C++ program:
    ```bash
    g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
    ./program_name
    ```

MATLAB programs can be run directly within the MATLAB environment.
